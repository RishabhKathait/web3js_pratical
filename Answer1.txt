Web3.js and Ether.js are both maintained by the Ethereum Foundation.So there is wider support for web3.js,as more 
developers are behind it.

Ether.js is developed and maintained by Rick Moore A Canadian Developer

One major difference between Ether.js and Web3.js us how they handle key management an interaction with the Ethereum 
Blockchain.

Web3.js assumes that there is local node connected to the application.

It's assumed that the node to store keys ,signs transactions and interacts with the Ethereum blockchain.

In reality this is not often the case most users are not running geth locally.

Metamask effectively emulates that enviroment through a browser application so most web3 apps require metamask to hold keys
,sign transactions and interact with the ethereum mainnet.

On the other hand Ether.js takes a diiferent approach that we beleive gives devlopers more flexibility.

Ether.js seperates the "node" into two seperate roles:

1) A "wallet" that holds keys and signed transactions.

2) A "Provider" that serves as an anonymous connection to the ethereum network, checking state and sending transactions.

The 2 main advantages of Ether.js that comes in mind are:

1) Ethereum Name Service(ENS) names are first-class citizens.

2) Key Management and State-Seperation of concerns.
